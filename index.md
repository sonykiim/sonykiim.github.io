### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was by far my favorite coding project. Coding things in animation sparks my interest as I get to play around with different techniques, colors, and shapes while excercising my artistic skills. I learned that before diving into animation, you need to have a good understanding of the basics, such as loops, variables, functions, and classes. Learning to code in animation is quite challenging for me but with time, patience, and practice, my partner and I were able to create an amazing animation!

* Lab 8 
    My second favorite project was lab 8. Specifically in part 1, I got to dabble in patterns and their algorithms. I was able to produce a pattern using three loops, one outer loop and two inner loops. I had fun creating interesting patterns by experimenting with different combinations of loops, conditional statements, and variables. Not only did it help me develop my programming skills, but it can also encourage my creativity and problem-solving abilitites.
