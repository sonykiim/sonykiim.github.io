### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was by far my favorite coding project. Coding things in animation sparks my interest as I get to play around with different techniques, colors, and shapes while excercising my artistic skills. I learned that before diving into animation, you need to have a good understanding of the basics, such as loops, variables, functions, and classes. While I was coding, I got to see my code in action, and the result is often a visually pleasing and interactive display. Learning to code in animation is quite challenging for me but with time, patience, and practice, my partner and I were able to create engaging and interactive animations that brought our code to life!

* Lab 8 
    My second favorite project was lab 8. Specifically in part 1, I got to dabble in patterns and their algorithms. Using loops to create patterns is a common practice, and it can be accomplished using several looping constructs, such as loops, while loops, and do-while loops. I was able to produce a pattern using three loops, one outer loop and two inner loops. I had fun creating interesting patterns by experimenting with different combinations of loops, conditional statements, and variables. Not only did it help me develop my programming skills, but it can also encourage my creativity and problem-solving abilitites to achieve the desired output. In addition, seeing our code create a beautiful pattern was very satisfying. 
    
* Lab 7
    Lab 7 was an interesting journey. Though, it belongs in my top 3 because it was a valuable learning experience. It was quite challenging since I am a new programmer who have limited experience. However, with the right approach and resources, my parter and I were able to make the process easier and more manageable. The game was broken down into smaller components. Blackjack has many different parts, such as dealing cards, calculating scores, and determining winners. By breaking the game down into smaller portions, the coding process was more manageable. Coding a blackjack game took a lot of my brain power but in the end it did help me improve my coding skills and learn new programming tools. I gained valuable experience in problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and software development.
